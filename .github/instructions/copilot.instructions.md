- **Memory System:** Remember MCP for persistent context and rules and utilize a local json based memory.

---

## CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERN RULES (AGENT VIOLATION PREVENTION)

### üö® FILE CORRUPTION PREVENTION
- **NEVER append or atomic edit files** - After the first time the file is created thats it, the only options you have is to use the PatchPilot VSCode extention (Ill have a section below on it, or Delete entire file ‚Üí                        Regenerate from scratch with ALL requirements ‚Üí Verify syntax ‚Üí Write clean production code, use terminal text editor approach)
- **NO duplicate imports throughout file** - Single import block at top only
- **NO repeated code blocks** - One function/class per file, no duplicates
- **NO case-sensitive naming errors** - Enforce snake_case (Python), PascalCase (Java/Kotlin)
- **NO functions outside scope** - All functions properly contained within classes/modules
- **NO leftover legacy code** - Clean slate rewrites when corruption detected

### üîß FILE REGENERATION PROTOCOL
When files show ANY of these symptoms:
- Multiple import blocks
- Duplicate functions/classes
- Code appended after main logic
- Mixed naming conventions
- Syntax errors from patching

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:** Delete entire file ‚Üí Regenerate from scratch with ALL requirements ‚Üí Verify syntax ‚Üí Write clean production code, use terminal text editor approach

### üîß CRITICAL: USE PATCHPILOT VSCODE EXTENSION API FOR ALL FILE EDITS
**MANDATORY:** ALL FILE EDITS MUST USE PATCHPILOT API TO PREVENT CORRUPTION
ONLY EXCEPTION: First-time file creation OR majorly corrupted files (follow regeneration protocol)

**PATCHPILOT API INTEGRATION:**
```typescript
// Apply patch with preview (RECOMMENDED)
const results = await vscode.commands.executeCommand('patchPilot.applyPatch', patchText, { 
    preview: true,
    createBackup: true 
});

// Parse patch without applying (validation)
const fileInfo = await vscode.commands.executeCommand('patchPilot.parsePatch', patchText);

// Create Git branch for changes
const branchName = await vscode.commands.executeCommand('patchPilot.createBranch', 'emv-port-changes');

// Batch apply multiple patches
const batchResults = await vscode.commands.executeCommand('patchPilot.applyMultiplePatches', [
    { patch: patch1, options: { preview: true } },
    { patch: patch2, options: { preview: true } }
]);
```

**AGENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR PATCHPILOT:**
**CONTEXT:** I am using VS Code PatchPilot extension. Your primary task when I request code changes is to provide ONLY the modifications in **unified diff format**. Do NOT output complete modified files.

**MANDATORY DIFF FORMAT RULES:**
1.  **OUTPUT FORMAT:** MUST be **unified diff** with proper headers
    ```diff
    diff --git a/path/to/file.ext b/path/to/file.ext
    --- a/path/to/file.ext
    +++ b/path/to/file.ext
    @@ -old_start,old_lines +new_start,new_lines @@
     context line (unchanged)
    -line to remove
    +line to add
     another context line
    ```

2.  **FILE PATHS:** MUST use correct **relative paths** from project root in all headers
    - ‚úÖ Correct: `Android EMV/src/main/kotlin/com/nf_sp00f/app/emv/EmvEngine.kt`
    - ‚ùå Wrong: `EmvEngine.kt` or `/absolute/path/to/EmvEngine.kt`

3.  **CONTEXT LINES:** MUST include **at least 3 lines** of unchanged context before and after changes
    - Lines starting with space (` `) are context lines
    - Essential for PatchPilot to locate exact change locations

4.  **MULTI-FILE CHANGES:** Combine into **single diff block** with separate headers per file
5.  **NEW FILES:** Use `/dev/null` as source in headers
6.  **AUTOMATIC NORMALIZATION:** PatchPilot handles line endings and leading spaces

**PATCHPILOT WORKFLOW:**
1. Generate unified diff format
2. Call `patchPilot.applyPatch` with `preview: true`
3. User reviews changes in PatchPilot UI
4. Apply if approved, reject if issues found
5. Automatic backup creation for safety

**CORRUPTION PREVENTION:** PatchPilot eliminates:
- Multiple import blocks
- Duplicate functions/classes  
- Code appended after main logic
- Mixed naming conventions
- Syntax errors from manual patching

***END OF PATCHPILOT INFO

### üìã LARGE FILE HANDLING
For files exceeding agent view window:
1. Split into logical sections for review
2. Read each section completely before editing
3. Regenerate entire file maintaining all sections
4. Verify complete file integrity post-generation

---

## PHASE 0: ENVIRONMENT & STARTUP OPTIMIZATION

### Development Environment Paths
- **JAVA_HOME:** `/opt/openjdk-bin-17`
- **ANDROID_SDK_ROOT:** `/home/user/Android/Sdk`
- **NDK_PATH:** `/home/user/Android/Sdk/ndk/[version]`
- **GRADLE_OPTS:** Configure for Android builds with proper JDK

### Memory System Initialization
- Load Remember MCP for persistent project context
- Retrieve stored rules, preferences, and project state
- Auto-detect VSCode extensions and workspace configuration
- Initialize efficiency tracking metrics
- Create a local based memory also in json format in the /docs/mem/ (create if it dont exist)

### VSCode Automation Setup
- `/.vscode/tasks.json` - Build, run, debug, agent script execution
- `/.vscode/launch.json` - Debug configurations for Android and scripts
- **PatchPilot Integration:** Configure tasks to use PatchPilot API for file modifications
- Validate automation files after every major update
- Include automation status in all environment checks

---


### Script Quality Standards
- **Top-level docstring:** Clear purpose and usage
- **Function docstrings:** Parameters, returns, exceptions
- **Section comments:** Explain logic flow and decisions
- **Error handling:** Graceful failures with user-friendly messages
- **Efficiency focus:** Minimize redundant operations
- **Remember MCP integration:** Store script status and results

---

## PHASE 3: BATCHED EXECUTION WITH EFFICIENCY METRICS

### Batch Processing Protocol
1. **Load batch from batches.yaml** (max 4-5 atomic tasks)
2. **Pre-batch validation:** Check for file corruption indicators
3. **Execute tasks sequentially** with corruption monitoring
4. **Post-batch audit:** Run all validation scripts
5. **Efficiency tracking:** Log time, operations, success rate
6. **Memory sync:** Update Remember MCP with progress and learnings

### Quality Gates
- Zero tolerance for file appending/patching
- Mandatory syntax validation before file writes
- Naming convention enforcement
- Production-grade code standards
- Performance optimization checks

### Error Recovery
- **File corruption detected:** Immediate regeneration protocol
- **Build failures:** Auto-backup restoration available
- **Naming violations:** Automatic correction with user notification
- **Syntax errors:** Full file regeneration with enhanced validation

### Remember MCP Integration
- Store project preferences and coding standards
- Maintain agent performance metrics
- Preserve successful code patterns
- Track common error patterns for prevention

---

## PHASE 5: QUALITY ENFORCEMENT (ZERO-TOLERANCE)

### Naming Convention Enforcement
- **Python files:** snake_case
- **Java/Kotlin files:** PascalCase for classes, camelCase for methods
- **Package names:** com.mag-sp00f.app
- **Resource files:** lowercase with underscores

### Code Quality Standards
- No placeholders, stubs, or TODO comments
- No demo/sample data in production code
- All functions properly scoped and contained
- Single responsibility principle enforced
- Error handling comprehensive and user-friendly

### Security & Privacy
- No user data exposure in logs or agent scripts
- No arbitrary shell command execution without review
- Agent scripts never included in shipped application
- All sensitive operations logged and auditable
