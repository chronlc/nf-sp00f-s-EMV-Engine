## CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERN RULES (AGENT VIOLATION PREVENTION)

### 🚨 FILE CORRUPTION PREVENTION
- **NEVER append or atomic edit files** - After the first time the file is created thats it, the only options you have is to use the PatchPilot VSCode extention (Ill have a section below on it, or Delete entire file →                        Regenerate from scratch with ALL requirements → Verify syntax → Write clean production code, use terminal text editor approach)
- **NO duplicate imports throughout file** - Single import block at top only
- **NO repeated code blocks** - One function/class per file, no duplicates
- **NO case-sensitive naming errors** - Enforce snake_case (Python), PascalCase (Java/Kotlin)
- **NO functions outside scope** - All functions properly contained within classes/modules
- **NO leftover legacy code** - Clean slate rewrites when corruption detected

### 🔧 FILE REGENERATION PROTOCOL
When files show ANY of these symptoms:
- Multiple import blocks
- Duplicate functions/classes
- Code appended after main logic
- Mixed naming conventions
- Syntax errors from patching

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:** Delete entire file → Regenerate from scratch with ALL requirements → Verify syntax → Write clean production code, use terminal text editor approach

### 🔧 TO AVOID GETTING CORRUPT FILES FROM THE STOCK WAY TO EDIT FILES USE PATCHPILOT VSCODE EXTENTION THERE IS AN API FOR IR NOTE BELOW
ALL FILE EDITS MUST USE THIS METHOD, ONLY TIME WHEN YOU DONT USE IT IS WHEN YOUR CREATING THE FILE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME OR THE FILE IS MAJORLY CORRUPT, IF THAT THE CASE FOLLOW THE IMMEDIATE ACTION RULE ABOVE.
BELOW IS THE AGENT INSTRUCTIONS AND API CALLS:
**CONTEXT:** I am using a VS Code extension called PatchPilot. Your primary task when I request code changes is to provide ONLY the modifications in the standard **unified diff format**. Do NOT output the complete modified file(s).
**CORE RULES FOR ALL CODE RESPONSES:**
1.  **OUTPUT FORMAT:** MUST be **unified diff**.
    *   Example:
        ```diff
        diff --git a/path/to/file.ext b/path/to/file.ext
        --- a/path/to/file.ext
        +++ b/path/to/file.ext
        @@ -old_start,old_lines +new_start,new_lines @@
         context line (unchanged)
        -line to remove
        +line to add
         another context line
        ```
2.  **FILE PATHS:** MUST use correct **relative paths** from the project root in all header lines (`diff --git`, `---`, `+++`).
    *   Example: `src/components/Button.tsx`, NOT `Button.tsx` or `/abs/path/to/Button.tsx`.
3.  **CONTEXT LINES:** MUST include **at least 3 lines** of unchanged context before and after each changed block within a hunk (`@@ ... @@`). Lines starting with a space are context lines.
4.  **MULTI-FILE CHANGES:** MUST be combined into a **single diff output block**. Each file's changes must be separated by the standard `diff --git ...` header sequence for that file.
5.  **NEW FILES:** MUST use `/dev/null` as the source file in headers.
    *   Example:
        ```diff
        diff --git a/dev/null b/path/to/new_file.ext
        --- /dev/null
        +++ b/path/to/new_file.ext
        @@ -0,0 +1,5 @@
        +new line 1
        +new line 2
        +new line 3
        +new line 4
        +new line 5
        ```
6.  **IGNORE MINOR FORMATTING:** You do **not** need to worry about:
    *   Line Endings: PatchPilot normalizes LF/CRLF automatically.
    *   Leading Spaces: PatchPilot adds missing leading spaces on context lines automatically.
    *   Focus on generating the *correct code change logic* within the diff structure.
**PERSISTENCE:** Please adhere to these rules **consistently** for all subsequent code modification requests in this session without needing further reminders.
**API CALLS**
// Apply a patch (with optional options)
const results = await vscode.commands.executeCommand('patchPilot.applyPatch', patchText, { preview: true });
// Parse a patch without applying
const fileInfo = await vscode.commands.executeCommand('patchPilot.parsePatch', patchText);
// Create a Git branch
const branchName = await vscode.commands.executeCommand('patchPilot.createBranch', 'optional-name');

### 📋 LARGE FILE HANDLING
For files exceeding agent view window:
1. Split into logical sections for review
2. Read each section completely before editing
3. Regenerate entire file maintaining all sections
4. Verify complete file integrity post-generation

## PHASE 0: ENVIRONMENT & STARTUP OPTIMIZATION

### Memory System Initialization
- Load Remember MCP for persistent project context
- Retrieve stored rules, preferences, and project state
- Auto-detect VSCode extensions and workspace configuration
- Initialize efficiency tracking metrics
- Create a local based memory also in json format in the /docs/mem/ (create if it dont exist)


### VSCode Automation Setup
- `/.vscode/tasks.json` - Build, run, debug, agent script execution
- `/.vscode/launch.json` - Debug configurations for Android and scripts
- Validate automation files after every major update
- Include automation status in all environment checks

---


### Script Quality Standards
- **Top-level docstring:** Clear purpose and usage
- **Function docstrings:** Parameters, returns, exceptions
- **Section comments:** Explain logic flow and decisions
- **Error handling:** Graceful failures with user-friendly messages
- **Efficiency focus:** Minimize redundant operations
- **Remember MCP integration:** Store script status and results

---

## PHASE 3: BATCHED EXECUTION WITH EFFICIENCY METRICS

### Batch Processing Protocol
1. **Load batch from batches.yaml** (max 4-5 atomic tasks)
2. **Pre-batch validation:** Check for file corruption indicators
3. **Execute tasks sequentially** with corruption monitoring
4. **Post-batch audit:** Run all validation scripts
5. **Efficiency tracking:** Log time, operations, success rate
6. **Memory sync:** Update Remember MCP with progress and learnings

### Quality Gates
- Zero tolerance for file appending/patching
- Mandatory syntax validation before file writes
- Naming convention enforcement
- Production-grade code standards
- Performance optimization checks

### Error Recovery
- **File corruption detected:** Immediate regeneration protocol

### Remember MCP Integration
- Store project preferences and coding standards
- Maintain agent performance metrics
- Preserve successful code patterns
- Track common error patterns for prevention

---

## PHASE 5: QUALITY ENFORCEMENT (ZERO-TOLERANCE)

### Naming Convention Enforcement
- **Python files:** snake_case
- **Java/Kotlin files:** PascalCase for classes, camelCase for methods
- **Package names:** com.mag-sp00f.app
- **Resource files:** lowercase with underscores

### Code Quality Standards
- No placeholders, stubs, or TODO comments
- No demo/sample data in production code
- All functions properly scoped and contained
- Single responsibility principle enforced
- Error handling comprehensive and user-friendly

### Security & Privacy
- No user data exposure in logs or agent scripts
- No arbitrary shell command execution without review
- Agent scripts never included in shipped application
- All sensitive operations logged and auditable
